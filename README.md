# Digital Communication - Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)

This is a simulation for Information transmission using QPSK also known as quadriphase PSK, 4-PSK, or 4-QAM.QPSK uses four points on the constellation diagram, equispaced around a circle. With four phases, QPSK can encode two bits per symbol
